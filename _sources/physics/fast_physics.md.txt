# Fast Physics for Drones

Fast Physics calculates rigid body motion for the drone modelled as a cuboid body frame with attached rotors treated as point masses.

Aerodynamic drag is calculated for the cuboid body faces and the cylindrical drag faces of the rotors.

Simple collision responses are handled based on collision detection by Unreal for the robot's body frame mesh.
