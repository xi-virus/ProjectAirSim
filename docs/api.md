# API Overview

---

## API Notes

1. Stability: APIs are evolving at this stage and could change based on the feedback. So please do provide feedback.
2. AirSim Compatibility: It is NOT a goal to maintain strict backward compatibility with GitHub AirSim project APIs. Wherever appropriate, learnings from AirSim project are used to update the APIs in this version. At the same time, a lot of familiar concepts have been carried over to enable smooth transition for users who are familiar with GitHub AirSim.

## API Concepts

1. Entities: The user code interacts with the simulation backend via these 3 objects:
    - Client: provides APIs for connection management between user code (a.k.a. simulation client) and simulation backend.
    - World:  provides APIs for simulation environment management (loading of scene, clock management, weather management, etc.)
    - Robot specific entities, e.g. Drone: provides APIs for robot control as well as sensor data.
2. Controls and Sensor data channels: The user code will typically send the control commands to the simulation backend using request-response model while it would subscribe to sensor data via the publish-subscribe model.
3. Async APIs: APIs that end with *Async return the control back to the user code immediately after invoking the call. It is expected that the users will use language specific async models to interact with these APIs, e.g., for Python clients, the user code would use asyncio package to interact with the *Async APIs.
4. Units: Unless specified otherwise, the API inputs and outputs are assumed to be in SI units (meters and radians) and in NED convention.

## Client Authorization

The Project AirSim server may optionally enable client authorization verification (to enable this, see the ["-clientauthpubkey" command line option](command_line_switches.md)).  When client authorization verification is enabled, clients must present a valid client authorization token immediately after connecting and before calling other API methods (include creating a `World` object).  If a valid unexpired token is not set or the token expires, API calls return a "client not authorized" error and the client won't received updates to subscribed topics.

To present a client authorization token, call the [`set_authorization_token()`]() method.  This method returns a `datetime` object for when the authorization expires (or expired.)  The client must present a new token before the current token expires to continue using the client API.

## API Example

### Python

(please see hello_drone.py for complete code)

```python
    import asyncio
    # Import ProjectAirSim client libraries
    from projectairsim import ProjectAirSimClient, World, Drone

    async def main():
        # Create client object
        client = ProjectAirSimClient()
        client.connect()

        # Create world object and load the scene from its config
        world = World(client, "scene_basic_drone.jsonc", delay_after_load_sec=2)

        # Create drone object
        drone = Drone(client, world, "Drone1")

        # Control drone
        move_up = await drone.move_by_velocity_async(
            v_north=0.0, v_east=0.0, v_down=-1.0, duration=4.0
        )
        await move_up

        client.disconnect()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
```

### Mapping API

- [`create_voxel_grid(position, x_size, y_size, z_size, res, write_file, file_path)`]() - Creates a voxel grid for the current scene. Can Output a `.binvox` file that represets the grid and returns a 1D occupancy array.

The index in the occupancy array for a particular point (needs to be within the bounds determined through the params) in the scene can be calculated as follows:

```
Center Coords: x_c, y_c, z_c // in m
Desired Point: x, y, z // in m

array-index = x_idx + x_cells * (z_idx + z_cells * y_idx)

Here,
x_cells = x_size/resolution (similar for z_cells)
x_idx = x + x_cells/2 - x_c (similar for y_idx and z_idx)
```

Value of the the array at this index (True or False) determines the occupancy of that cell.

NOTE: Currenly, only a cubic area of intrest is supported (x_size = y_size = z_size)
