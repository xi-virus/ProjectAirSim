# Weather Visual Effects

For details on using weather visual effects through the client API, see **[Weather Visual Effects API](../api.md#weather-visual-effects)**.

If running the sim locally with the game viewport (stand-alone game or in Editor), a GUI for setting weather visual effects can be activated by pressing the F10 key.
