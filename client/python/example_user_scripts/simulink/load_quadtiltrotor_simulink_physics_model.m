% Usage
% 1. In Matlab, run script by pasting the following in the Command Window:
% >> load_quadtiltrotor_simulink_physics_model
%
% 2. Open and start the simulation server.
% 3. In an activated virtual environment, run the following in the
% example_user_scripts directory:
% python simulink_physics_quadtiltrotor.py
