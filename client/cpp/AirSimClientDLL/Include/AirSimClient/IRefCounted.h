// Objects of this type can only be deleted through the Release() method

// messing up the heap.
//
// Callers to a method that crosses the DLL boundary passes in an object
// of a subclass of RefCountedContainer.  The method on the other side of
// the boundary allocates an instance of a subclass of IRefCounted and
// sets it into the RefCountedContainer object.  The caller then interacts
// with the container as if it were the wrapped object and deletes the
// container like normal when done.
//
// Unlike containers, ISelfDelete objects must be allocated from the heap.

// Objects of a subclass of this class wrap ISelfDelete objects so that
// code on one side of the DLL boundary can safely receive objects allocated
// on the other side yet when the objects are deleted they are deleted on
// the same side of the DLL boundary and avoid corrupting the heaps on
// either side.  Containers must never be allocated on one side of the DLL
// boundary and deleted on the other.
//
// Code typically allocate an object of a subclass of this class and pass
// a pointer or a reference to it across the DLL boundary.  The code on
// the other side allocates an object inheriting ISelfDelete and sets it
// into the SelfDeleteContainer object.  The caller then interacts with
// the container which typically just forwards calls to the ISelfDelete
// subclass object methods.  Deleting the container calls the
// ISelfDelete::Release() method which invokes the code on other side of
// the boundary to correctly delete the ISelfDelete object and return the
// memory to the originating heap.
//
// Containers can be on the stack or allocated from the heap.
