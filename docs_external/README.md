# Welcome to Project AirSim

_Non-public information provided under the terms of Non-Disclosure Agreement with Microsoft Corporation_

**Project AirSim** is an enterprise grade platform to enable rapid development of machine intelligence-centric autonomous systems, involving agents like drones and factory robots operating in the physical world.

In the initial phase, the platform will provide two solution components:

1. **AI-First Simulation** platform

2. Collection of **Autonomy Blocks**

The current drops contain the simulation platform; the autonomy blocks will be added in future drops.

_Project AirSim_ is a name used for pre-release drops and the product name is likely to change in future releases.

## AI-First simulation platform

Related to Microsoft's **[AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim)**, the simulation plaform leverages **[Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/)** to provide photo-realistic visuals, while providing the simulation framework needed to integrate custom physics, controllers, actuators, and sensors to develop an autonomous system.

The simulation platform consists of 3 main layers:

1. **Project AirSim Sim Libs** - Base infrastructure for defining a generic robot structure and simulation scene tick loop

2. **Project AirSim Plugin** - Host package (currently an Unreal Plugin) that builds on the sim libs core to connect external components (controller, physics, rendering) at runtime that are specific to each configured robot-type scenario (ex. quadrotor drones)

3. **Project AirSim Client Library** - End-user library to enable API calls to interact with the robot and simulation over a network connection

The Project AirSim simulation platform currently supports Windows 10/Server 2019 and Ubuntu 20.04. For more info about hardware specs for working with Project AirSim, see **[System Specifications](system_specs.md)**.

## Autonomy blocks

Autonomy blocks are a collection of ML-centric building blocks that enable rapid development of autonomous solutions like drone landing using camera, drone navigation, etc.
If you are interested in exploring and/or building machine learning applications and models for autonomous perception/planning/control tasks, you can leverage the pre-trained models, datasets and learning environments in Project AirSim.
